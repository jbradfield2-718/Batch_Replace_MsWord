Batch Replace in MsWord via Excel Input
========================

Project is essentially a simple improved Mail Merge clone for MsWord.
Practice to help learn how to create simple apps using VB.

That said, the code could be easily modified to expand the functionality for 
custom purposes, such as arithmatic manipulation of numerical value replacements
in multiple Word documents, etc.

 - Instructions for program included with .exe file.
 - No need to create special special Form field formatting in Word file--searches and replaces strings.
 - Allows each output letter to be individually named.
 - Link properly formatted Excel input file and Word template.
